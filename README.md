# Domain Hunter 🕵️‍♂️

## What's This About? 🤔
This script is like a digital treasure hunter! 🕵️‍♂️ It helps you find available domains and check their prices. It's like a digital treasure map, but with more code! 📜

## Why Use This Script? 🤷‍♂️
- It's like a digital treasure hunt! 🕵️‍♂️
- It helps you find available domains (like finding treasure 💎)
- It checks domain prices (because money matters)
- It creates a report (because we're professional like that)
- It's like a digital treasure map but with more code! 📜

## The Cool Features 🌟

- IP Resolution (turns numbers into names, like magic! 🎩)
- WHOIS Lookup (finds out who owns what)
- Price Checking (so you don't break the bank 💸)
- Automatic Report Generation (because who likes writing reports?)
- Handles Multiple IP Sources (it's greedy like that)
- Error Handling (because stuff happens 🤷‍♂️)

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x (the newer the better!)
- python-whois (for being nosey about domains)
- requests (for talking to the internet)
- A cup of coffee ☕ (script runs better with caffeine)
- Patience (it's thorough, like your grandma checking your homework)
